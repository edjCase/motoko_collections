# Overview

This is a Motoko library providing extended collections including a dynamic array implementation and other data structures.

## Components

-   **DynamicArray** (`src/DynamicArray.mo`): A dynamic array implementation extracted and adapted from the deprecated [motoko-base](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base) library's `Buffer` module to keep this functionality alive and maintained.
-   Additional collection types and utilities (future additions will be original work)
